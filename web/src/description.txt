  "summary": "The timeline represented here is an interactive data visualization tool that reflects the San Diego region’s economy through the ages using historical data from various sources.",
  "about": "The history of San Diego is one of ambition, innovation, and reinvention. Humans have inhabited this corner of the North American continent for millennia, drawn to its temperate weather, spectacular coastline, and abundant natural resources. More than a century ago, new settlers imagined this place as a vacation paradise, an anchor for America’s young Navy, and a center of 20th century culture, education, and expanding technological horizons. Along the way, people with an eye on the region’s future – civic leaders, businesspeople, philanthropists, and everyday citizens – built San Diego by investing in visions of what our region could be. As we trace the contours of San Diego history in this interactive timeline, we are reminded that it’s our turn, today, to shape our region’s future. Our vision, and our commitment to those who come after us, will write the next chapter in San Diego’s history."
